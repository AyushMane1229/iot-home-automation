# üè† Home Automation IoT Project  
*Internship Project @ Emertxe*

A complete IoT-based home automation system built during my internship at Emertxe. This project uses hardware sensors, simulation via PicSimLab, and the Blynk mobile app for remote control and monitoring.

---

## üöÄ Project Features

- **Garden Lights Automation**  
  Automates LED brightness using an LDR sensor and PWM based on ambient light levels.

- **Temperature Monitoring & Control**  
  Reads temperature via an LM35 sensor. Automatically toggles heater or cooler via relays. Displays live readings on CLCD and Blynk with alerts when thresholds (e.g., 35‚ÄØ¬∞C) are crossed.

- **Water Tank Valve Control**  
  Monitors water tank level via serial communication. Automatically controls inlet/outlet valves based on level thresholds (e.g., maintain above 2000‚ÄØL) with full manual override and push-button control via Blynk.

    - Install the Blynk app on your phone and copy the Auth Token

2. Run the Simulation

    - Open simulation/home_automation.pzw in PicSimLab

    - Connect virtual sensors, relays, LEDs, valves, and serial module accordingly

3. Upload Firmware

    - Open firmware/HomeAutomation.ino in Arduino IDE

    - Add your Blynk Auth Token

    - Upload the code to your Arduino Uno

4. Operate the System

    - Start simulation in PicSimLab

    - Launch Blynk on your phone

    - Control garden lights, heater/cooler, and tank valves from the mobile dashboard
